A prototype-based language is a type of programming language that is centered around the concept of prototypes for object-oriented programming. In a prototype-based language, objects are not instantiated from classes as in class-based languages (like Java or C++); instead, objects are created by cloning existing objects, which serve as prototypes.

In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an {{Glossary('Object', 'object')}} without first defining its {{Glossary('Class', 'class')}}.
